Bugs encountered in my server while writing ex5:

1. 	This was the only serious bug I found: 
	I didn't handle cookies well. The method that added cookies to the response was wrong, 
	and also the way that I parsed the cookies to the response was wrong (it was non existant).
2.	path.normalize usage was added to hujiwebserver.static method.
3. 	another minor bug that I don't remember
